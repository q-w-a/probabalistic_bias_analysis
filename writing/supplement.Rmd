# Specification of the Priors


```{r ctis-by-state, fig.cap ="Since $\\beta$ represents the ratio of $\\Pr(\\text{test}_+|\\text{untested}, S_0)$ to $\\Pr(\\text{test}_+|\\text{tested})$, we estimate $\\beta$ from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey as the ratio of the screening test positivity over the overall test positivity. Here, we consider the 2.5\\% and 97.5\\% percentiles and mean for each state. Most have a mean near $20%$."}

# Details on Each Implementation


```{r covidestim-concordance-state, fig.cap="For each implementation, the proportions of simulation intervals where the Covidestim median was below, within, or above the interval are shown, across all states used for the implementation."}
