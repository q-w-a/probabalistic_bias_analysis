  abstract = {Background               The global epidemiological situation of COVID-19 remains serious. The rapid hunting of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the key means for preventing transmission.                                         Methods               A total of 40,689 consecutive overseas arrivals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on PCR and serologic testing. The yield and efficiency of different screening algorithms were evaluated.                                         Result               Among the 40,689 consecutive overseas arrivals, 56 (0.14\%) subjects were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The asymptomatic rate was 76.8\%. When the algorithm based on PCR alone was used, the identification yield of a single round of PCR (PCR1) was only 39.3\% (95\% CI: 26.1–52.5\%). It took at least four rounds of PCR to achieve a yield of 92.9\% (95\% CI: 85.9–99.8\%). Fortunately, an algorithm based on a single round of PCR combined with a single round of serologic testing (PCR1+ Ab1) greatly improved the screening yield to 98.2\% (95\% CI: 94.6–100.0\%) and required 42,299 PCR and 40,689 serologic tests that cost 6,052,855 yuan. By achieving a similar yield, the cost of PCR1+ Ab1 was 39.2\% of that of four rounds of PCR. For hunting one case in PCR1+ Ab1, 769 PCR and 740 serologic tests were required, costing 110,052 yuan, which was 63.0\% of that of the PCR1 algorithm.                                         Conclusion               Comparing an algorithm based on PCR alone, PCR combined with a serologic testing algorithm greatly improved the yield and efficiency of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

  abstract = {We provide two methods for monitoring reinfection trends in routine surveillance data to identify signatures of changes in reinfection risk and apply these approaches to data from South Africa’s severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic to date. Although we found no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of the Beta (B.1.351) or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, we did find clear, population-level evidence to suggest immune evasion by the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in previously infected individuals in South Africa. Reinfections occurring between 1 November 2021 and 31 January 2022 were detected in individuals infected in all three previous waves, and there has been an increase in the risk of having a third infection since mid-November 2021.           ,              Omicron and reinfection risk                            So far, our experience with pandemic coronavirus has been that the emergence of new variants is not detected until there has been substantial community transmission. Early in November 2021, South African scientists spotted reinfections consistent with the timing of the emergence of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). In a population largely untouched by vaccines but widely infected, Pulliam               et al               . found that Beta or Delta variants rarely caused reinfection. However, after 31 October 2021, individuals were found who had had three experiences of infection (see the Perspective by Zelner and Eisenberg). The culprit was the rapidly emerging Omicron variant, with multiple mutations in the Spike protein. This variant’s chief advantage is its ability to evade naturally acquired immunity. Fortunately, the Omicron variant does not fully evade vaccine-derived immunity, but only those privileged to have been vaccinated can benefit. —CA                        ,              Analysis of routine surveillance data from South Africa indicates that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 evades immunity from prior infection.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Globally, there have been more than 404 million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with 5.8 million confirmed deaths as of February 2022. South Africa has experienced four waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with the second, third, and fourth waves being driven by the Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, respectively. A key question with the emergence of new variants is the extent to which they are able to reinfect those who have had a prior natural infection.                                         RATIONALE               We developed two approaches to monitor routine epidemiological surveillance data to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk has changed through time in South Africa in the context of the emergence of the Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. We analyzed line-list data on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 with specimen receipt dates between 4 March 2020 and 31 January 2022 collected through South Africa’s National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System. Individuals having sequential positive tests at least 90 days apart were considered to have suspected reinfections. Our routine monitoring of reinfection risk included comparison of reinfection rates with the expectation under a null model (approach 1) and estimation of the time-varying hazards of infection and reinfection throughout the epidemic (approach 2) based on model-based reconstruction of the susceptible populations eligible for primary and second infections.                                         RESULTS               A total of 105,323 suspected reinfections were identified among 2,942,248 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days before 31 January 2022. The number of reinfections observed through the end of the third wave in September 2021 was consistent with the null model of no change in reinfection risk (approach 1). Although increases in the hazard of primary infection were observed after the introduction of both the Beta and Delta variants, no corresponding increase was observed in the reinfection hazard (approach 2). Contrary to expectation, the estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection was lower during waves driven by the Beta and Delta variants than for the first wave: the relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1 was 0.71 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.60 to 0.85]; the relative hazard ratio for wave 3 versus wave 1 was 0.54 (95\% CI: 0.45 to 0.64). By contrast, the recent spread of the Omicron variant has been associated with an increase in reinfection hazard coefficient. The estimated relative hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection versus wave 1 was 1.75 (95\% CI: 1.48 to 2.10) for the period of Omicron emergence (1 November 2021 to 30 November 2021) and 1.70 (95\% CI: 1.44 to 2.04) for wave 4 versus wave 1. Individuals with identified reinfections since 1 November 2021 had experienced primary infections in all three prior waves, and an increase in third infections has been detected since mid-November 2021. Many individuals experiencing third infections had second infections during the third (Delta) wave that ended in September 2021, strongly suggesting that these infections resulted from immune evasion rather than waning immunity.                                         CONCLUSION               Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with a marked ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries such as South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. The further development of methods to track reinfection risk during pathogen emergence, including refinements to assess the impact of waning immunity, account for vaccine-derived protection, and monitor the risk of multiple reinfections, will be important for future pandemic preparedness.                                                   SARS-CoV-2 reinfection patterns in South Africa.                   South Africa has experienced four waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, each driven by the emergence of a new variant. Reinfection of previously infected individuals was relatively rare through the end of the third wave. Methods developed in South Africa to monitor reinfection trends led to the early detection of increased reinfection risk associated with the Omicron variant.},

  abstract = {Significance             Asymptomatic infections have been widely reported for COVID-19. However, many studies do not distinguish between the presymptomatic stage and truly asymptomatic infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 literature reporting laboratory-confirmed infections to determine the burden of asymptomatic infections and removed index cases from our calculations to avoid conflation. By analyzing over 350 papers, we estimated that more than one-third of infections are truly asymptomatic. We found evidence of greater asymptomaticity in children compared with the elderly, and lower asymptomaticity among cases with comorbidities compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Greater asymptomaticity at younger ages suggests that heightened vigilance is needed among these individuals, to prevent spillover into the broader community.           ,              Quantification of asymptomatic infections is fundamental for effective public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discrepancies regarding the extent of asymptomaticity have arisen from inconsistent terminology as well as conflation of index and secondary cases which biases toward lower asymptomaticity. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 2, 2021 to identify studies that reported silent infections at the time of testing, whether presymptomatic or asymptomatic. Index cases were removed to minimize representational bias that would result in overestimation of symptomaticity. By analyzing over 350 studies, we estimate that the percentage of infections that never developed clinical symptoms, and thus were truly asymptomatic, was 35.1\% (95\% CI: 30.7 to 39.9\%). At the time of testing, 42.8\% (95\% prediction interval: 5.2 to 91.1\%) of cases exhibited no symptoms, a group comprising both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. Asymptomaticity was significantly lower among the elderly, at 19.7\% (95\% CI: 12.7 to 29.4\%) compared with children at 46.7\% (95\% CI: 32.0 to 62.0\%). We also found that cases with comorbidities had significantly lower asymptomaticity compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Without proactive policies to detect asymptomatic infections, such as rapid contact tracing, prolonged efforts for pandemic control may be needed even in the presence of vaccination.},

As the largest public health survey conducted in the United States to date, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid revision to address emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing, and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 mo of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting.           ,              The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey—over 20 million responses in its first year of operation—allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.},
